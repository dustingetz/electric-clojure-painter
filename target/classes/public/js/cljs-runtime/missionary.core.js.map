A reactor is a supervisor for a dynamic set of\nconcurrent flow processes called publishers, allowing each of them to share its values to multiple subscribers while\nensuring transactional propagation of their signaling events. A transaction is a point in time where several publishers\nare considered simultaneously active as a result of the propagation of an event through the subscription graph.\n\nDuring a transaction, a reactor may schedule and perform the following user actions :\n- calling the boot function\n- spawning a publisher\n- cancelling a publisher\n- transferring a publisher\n- signaling a subscription\n\nThe reactor allows the following user events to happen as a side-effect of any of these actions :\n- create a new publisher\n- detach an existing publisher\n- spawn a subscription\n- cancel a subscription\n- transfer a subscription\n\nA publisher process is allowed to signal at any point in time. If the signaling event happens as a side-effect of a\nuser space action of the publisher's reactor, it is considered part of the current transaction, otherwise a new\ntransaction is run.\n\n\n\n\nPublishers are spawned with `stream!` and `signal!`, respectively for discrete and continuous flows. This operation is\nallowed only as a side-effect of the evaluation of the boot function, or as a side-effect of another publisher action.\nIn the latter case, the publisher targeted by the action is the parent of the spawned publisher. Publishers thus form a\ntree where the top-level nodes are those spawned directly within the boot function. The post-order traversal of this\ntree, where siblings follow the birth order, defines a total order on publishers called the propagation order. The\nobject returned represents the publisher identity and provides two operations :\n* discard the publisher, when called with no argument.\n* spawn a new subscription to this publisher, when used as a flow. This operation is allowed only as a side-effect of a\npublisher action, and only if the subscribed publisher comes before the subscriber publisher in the propagation order.\nThis constraint effectively makes acyclic the publisher-subscription directed graph.\n\nWhen the reactor process is spawned, the boot function is immediately called with no argument and a new transaction is\nrun. The reactor process terminates with the value returned by the boot function when a transaction completes with no\nrunning publisher. As long as at least one publisher is running, the reactor reacts to the following events, if\ntriggered by the same thread as the one used to spawn the process :\n* cancelling the main process. All publishers are discarded along with those subsequently spawned.\n* notifying a publisher process. If the publisher is continuous, or if it is discrete and the previous dispatch has\nbeen acknowledged for every subscription, the publisher will be active in the current transaction or in the next one.\n* terminating a publisher process. The subscriptions of this publisher will terminate as soon as no transfer is pending.\nIf the publisher is discrete, subsequent subscriptions transfer no value and terminate immediately. If the publisher is\ncontinuous, the last value is considered as the final value, subsequent subscriptions transfer this value and terminate\nimmediately afterwards.\n* discarding a publisher. The publisher process is cancelled. If the publisher is continuous, transfers becomes eager.\n* transferring a subscription process. TODO\n* cancelling a subscription process. The next transfer fails with an instance of `missionary.Cancelled` and terminates\nimmediately afterwards. If the publisher is discrete and a transfer was pending, the dispatch is acknowledged for this\nsubscription.\n\n\n\nDuring a transaction, each publisher is allowed to notify its subscriptions, at most once. A publisher is active in a\\ntransaction if it becomes ready to transfer synchronously on a notification of a subscription in the same transaction\\n\n\n<TODO>\nPublisher emissions are grouped in propagation turns, where successive\npublishers of a given turn are strictly increasing.\n\n When a publisher becomes able to emit, it is compared to the\npublisher currently emitting to figure out whether the emission must happen on the current turn or on the next one.\nCyclic reactions are possible and no attempt is made to prevent them, so care must be taken to ensure the propagation\neventually stops. The dispatching mechanism depends on the nature of the publisher, discrete or continuous.\n* a stream is able to emit when its flow is ready to transfer and the backpressure of the previous emission has been\ncollected from all of its subscriptions. On emission, a value is transferred from the flow and subscriptions are\nnotified of the availability of this value. Until the end of the propagation turn, each new subscription to this stream\nwill be immediately notified.\n* a signal always has a current value, thus each new subscription is immediately notified. It is able to emit when its\nflow is ready to transfer. On emission, its current value is marked as stale and its subscriptions are notified if not\nalready. From this point, a sampling request from any of its subscriptions will trigger the transfer from the flow to\nrefresh the current value. Subsequent sampling requests will reuse this memoized value until next emission.\n</TODO>\n\n\nWhen a stream completes, ...\nWhen a signal completes, its latest value is treated as the final state. Active subscriptions terminate after having\ntransferred this value, subsequent subscriptions transfer only this value and complete afterwards.\n\nCalling a publisher as a zero-argument function cancels the underlying process. When cancelled, signals transfer eagerly.\nCancelling a subscription before termination makes it fail immediately with `Cancelled`.\n\nWhen a reactor is cancelled, all of its active publishers are cancelled along with any one subsequently spawned.\nWhen a publisher crashes, all of its active subscriptions are cancelled along with any one subsequently spawned.\nIf the boot function throws an exception, or any publisher crashes, the reactor is cancelled.\n\nA reactor terminates at the end of the first turn where every publisher flow is terminated, meaning no transfer can\never happen anymore. The task succeeds with the result of the boot function if no error happened, otherwise it fails\nwith the first error.\n\"} reactor-call (fn [i] (fn [s f] (Reactor/run i s f))))\n\n\n(defmacro\n  ^{:arglists '([& body])\n    :doc \"\nCalls `reactor-call` with a function evaluating given `body` in an implicit `do`.\n\"} reactor [& body] `(reactor-call (fn [] ~@body)))\n\n\n(def\n  ^{:static true\n    :arglists '([flow])\n    :doc \"\nSpawns a discrete publisher from given flow, see `reactor-call`.\n\"} stream!
